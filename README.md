## Why this project is so cool for learning

* **Design complexity**: VGA, FSM, PRNG, Timers, Buttons, BCD counter and Bitmap Font introduce more fun in a design
  process.
* **Area-focused optimizations**: In FPGA, you mainly perform optimizations related to timing requirements, but in ASIC,
  it is more important to keep the area of the design small.
* **Fun and Curiosity**: It is interesting to measure the speed of your own reaction and be sure that the input is not
  delayed by the CPU and the timer does not fail.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?
